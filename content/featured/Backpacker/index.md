Travelling is a major thing that people used to reduce stresses with their busy schedules. Selecting a proper location to travel to is one of the major problems where people get stuck when planning on travelling.

As a solution to this problem, we developed a mobile application that helps travellers to get an idea about locations around the world through this project.By using this application you can get the environment details and you can share it with other people and those data captured from sensors will be stored in a database. We can use those data in future for predictions and suggestions for people to travel.
